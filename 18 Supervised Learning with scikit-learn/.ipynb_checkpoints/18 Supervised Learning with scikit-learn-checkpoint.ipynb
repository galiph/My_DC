    "At the end of day, the value of Data Scientists rests on their ability to describe the world and to make predictions. Machine Learning is the field of teaching machines and computers to learn from existing data to make predictions on new data - will a given tumor be benign or malignant? Which of your customers will take their business elsewhere? Is a particular email spam or not? In this course, you'll learn how to use Python to perform supervised learning, an essential component of Machine Learning. You'll learn how to build predictive models, how to tune their parameters and how to tell how well they will perform on unseen data, all the while using real world datasets. You'll do so using scikit-learn, one of the most popular and user-friendly machine learning libraries for Python."

Your goal will be to predict their party affiliation ('Democrat' or 'Republican') based on how they voted on certain key issues. Here, it's worth noting that we have preprocessed this dataset to deal with missing values. This is so that your focus can be directed towards understanding how to train and evaluate supervised learning models. Once you have mastered these fundamentals, you will be introduced to preprocessing techniques in Chapter 4 and have the chance to apply them there yourself - including on this very same dataset!</p>\n",

    "<div class=\"exercise--assignment exercise--typography\"><h1 class=\"exercise--title\">Visual EDA</h1><p>The Numerical EDA you did in the previous exercise gave you some very important information, such as the names and data types of the columns, and the dimensions of the DataFrame. Following this with some visual EDA will give you an even better understanding of the data. In the video, Hugo used the <code>scatter_matrix()</code> function on the Iris data for this purpose. However, you may have noticed in the previous exercise that all the features in this dataset are binary; that is, they are either 0 or 1. So a different type of plot would be more useful here, such as <a href=\"http://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.countplot.html\" target=\"_blank\">Seaborn's <code>countplot</code></a>.</p>\n",
    "<p>Given on the right is a <code>countplot</code> of the <code>'education'</code> bill, generated from the following code:</p>\n",
    "<pre><code class=\"{python} language-{python}\">plt.figure()\n",
    "sns.countplot(x='education', hue='party', data=df, palette='RdBu')\n",
    "plt.xticks([0,1], ['No', 'Yes'])\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "<p>In <code>sns.countplot()</code>, we specify the x-axis data to be <code>'education'</code>, and hue to be <code>'party'</code>. Recall that <code>'party'</code> is also our target variable. So the resulting plot shows the difference in voting behavior between the two parties for the <code>'education'</code> bill, with each party colored differently. We manually specified the color to be <code>'RdBu'</code>, as the Republican party has been traditionally associated with red, and the Democratic party with blue.</p>\n",
    "<p>It seems like Democrats voted resoundingly <em>against</em> this bill, compared to Republicans. This is the kind of information that our machine learning model will seek to learn when we try to predict party affiliation solely based on voting behavior. An expert in U.S politics may be able to predict this without machine learning, but probably not instantaneously - and certainly not if we are dealing with hundreds of samples! </p>\n",
    "<p>In the IPython Shell, explore the voting behavior further by generating countplots for the <code>'satellite'</code> and <code>'missile'</code> bills, and answer the following question: Of these two bills, for which ones do Democrats vote resoundingly in <em>favor</em> of, compared to Republicans? Be sure to begin your plotting statements for each figure with <code>plt.figure()</code> so that a new figure will be set up. Otherwise, your plots will be overlayed onto the same figure.</p></div></div></div>"

    "<p>Each sample in this scikit-learn dataset is an 8x8 image representing a handwritten digit. Each pixel is represented by an integer in the range 0 to 16, indicating varying levels of black. Recall that scikit-learn's built-in datasets are of type <code>Bunch</code>, which are dictionary-like objects. Helpfully for the MNIST dataset, scikit-learn provides an <code>'images'</code> key in addition to the <code>'data'</code> and <code>'target'</code> keys that you have seen with the Iris data. Because it is a 2D array of the images corresponding to each sample, this <code>'images'</code> key is useful for visualizing the images, as you'll see in this exercise (for more on plotting 2D arrays, see <a href=\"https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-data-visualization-with-python\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 2</a> of DataCamp's course on Data Visualization with Python). On the other hand, the <code>'data'</code> key contains the feature array - that is, the images as a flattened array of 64 pixels.</p>\n",
    "<p>Notice that you can access the keys of these <code>Bunch</code> objects in two different ways: By using the <code>.</code> notation, as in <code>digits.images</code>, or the <code>[]</code> notation, as in <code>digits['images']</code>. </p>\n",
    "<p>For more on the MNIST data, check out <a href=\"https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/importing-data-in-python-part-1/introduction-and-flat-files-1?ex=10\" target=\"_blank\">this exercise</a> in Part 1 of DataCamp's Importing Data in Python course. There, the full version of the MNIST dataset is used, in which the images are 28x28. It is a famous dataset in machine learning and computer vision, and frequently used as a benchmark to evaluate the performance of a new model.</p></div></div></div>"

Specifically, your goal will be to use this data to predict the life expectancy in a given country based on features such as the country's GDP, fertility rate, and population.

To begin, you will fit a linear regression with just one feature: <code>'fertility'</code>, which is the average number of children a woman in a given country gives birth to. In later exercises, you will use all the features to build regression models.</p>\n",
    "<p>Before that, however, you need to import the data and get it into the form needed by scikit-learn. This involves creating feature and target variable arrays. Furthermore, since you are going to use only one feature to begin with, you need to do some reshaping using NumPy's <code>.reshape()</code> method. Don't worry too much about this reshaping right now, but it is something you will have to do occasionally when working with scikit-learn so it is useful to practice.</p></div></div></div>"

    "<div class=\"exercise--assignment exercise--typography\"><h1 class=\"exercise--title\">Fit &amp; predict for regression</h1><p>Now, you will fit a linear regression and predict life expectancy using just one feature. You saw Andy do this earlier using the <code>'RM'</code> feature of the Boston housing dataset. In this exercise, you will use the <code>'fertility'</code> feature of the Gapminder dataset. Since the goal is to predict life expectancy, the target variable here is <code>'life'</code>. The array for the target variable has been pre-loaded as <code>y</code> and the array for <code>'fertility'</code> has been pre-loaded as <code>X_fertility</code>.</p>\n",
    "<p>A scatter plot with <code>'fertility'</code> on the x-axis and <code>'life'</code> on the y-axis has been generated. As you can see, there is a strongly negative correlation, so a linear regression should be able to capture this trend. Your job is to fit a linear regression and then predict the life expectancy, overlaying these predicted values on the plot to generate a regression line. You will also compute and print the <span class=\"MathJax_Preview\" style=\"color: inherit; display: none;\"></span><span class=\"MathJax\" id=\"MathJax-Element-1-Frame\" tabindex=\"0\" style=\"position: relative;\" data-mathml=\"<math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;><msup><mi>R</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></math>\" role=\"presentation\"><nobr aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"math\" id=\"MathJax-Span-1\" style=\"width: 1.392em; display: inline-block;\"><span style=\"display: inline-block; position: relative; width: 1.175em; height: 0px; font-size: 117%;\"><span style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1.25em, 1001.18em, 2.425em, -1000em); top: -2.244em; left: 0em;\"><span class=\"mrow\" id=\"MathJax-Span-2\"><span class=\"msubsup\" id=\"MathJax-Span-3\"><span style=\"display: inline-block; position: relative; width: 1.188em; height: 0px;\"><span style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(3.163em, 1000.76em, 4.188em, -1000em); top: -4.006em; left: 0em;\"><span class=\"mi\" id=\"MathJax-Span-4\" style=\"font-family: MathJax_Math; font-style: italic;\">R</span><span style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 4.006em;\"></span></span><span style=\"position: absolute; top: -4.369em; left: 0.759em;\"><span class=\"mn\" id=\"MathJax-Span-5\" style=\"font-size: 70.7%; font-family: MathJax_Main;\">2</span><span style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 4.006em;\"></span></span></span></span></span><span style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 2.244em;\"></span></span></span><span style=\"display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; vertical-align: -0.087em; border-left: 0px solid; width: 0px; height: 1.125em;\"></span></span></nobr><span class=\"MJX_Assistive_MathML\" role=\"presentation\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><msup><mi>R</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></math></span></span><script type=\"math/tex\" id=\"MathJax-Element-1\">R^2</script> score using sckit-learn's <code>.score()</code> method.</p></div></div></div>"

    " Having trained your model, your next task is to evaluate its performance. What metrics can you use to gauge how good your model is? So far, you have used accuracy for classification and R-squared for regression. In this chapter, you will learn about some of the other metrics available in scikit-learn that will allow you to assess your model's performance in a more nuanced manner. You will then learn to optimize both your classification as well as regression models using hyperparameter tuning. "

However, as Andy discussed, accuracy is not always an informative metric. In this exercise, you will dive more deeply into evaluating the performance of binary classifiers by computing a confusion matrix and generating a classification report. </p>\n",
    "<p>You may have noticed in the video that the classification report consisted of three rows, and an additional <em>support</em> column. The <em>support</em> gives the number of samples of the true response that lie in that class - so in the video example, the support was the number of Republicans or Democrats in the test set on which the classification report was computed. The <em>precision</em>, <em>recall</em>, and <em>f1-score</em> columns, then, gave the respective metrics for that particular class.</p>\n",
    "<p>Here, you'll work with the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database\" target=\"_blank\">PIMA Indians</a> dataset obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The goal is to predict whether or not a given female patient will contract diabetes based on features such as BMI, age, and number of pregnancies. Therefore, it is a binary classification problem. A target value of <code>0</code> indicates that the patient does <em>not</em> have diabetes, while a value of <code>1</code> indicates that the patient <em>does</em> have diabetes. As in Chapters 1 and 2, the dataset has been preprocessed to deal with missing values.</p>\n",
    "<p>The dataset has been loaded into a DataFrame <code>df</code> and the feature and target variable arrays <code>X</code> and <code>y</code> have been created for you. In addition, <code>sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split</code> and <code>sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier</code> have already been imported.</p>\n",

It would be correct approximately 50% of the time, and the resulting ROC curve would be a diagonal line in which the True Positive Rate and False Positive Rate are always equal. The Area under this ROC curve would be 0.5. This is one way in which the AUC, which Hugo discussed in the video, is an informative metric to evaluate a model. If the AUC is greater than 0.5, the model is better than random guessing. Always a good sign!  </p>\n",

You saw in the previous exercise that the <code>'Region'</code> feature contains very useful information that can predict life expectancy. For example, Sub-Saharan Africa has a lower life expectancy compared to Europe and Central Asia. Therefore, if you are trying to predict life expectancy, it would be preferable to retain the <code>'Region'</code> feature. To do this, you need to binarize it by creating dummy variables, which is what you will do in this exercise.</p></div>"
